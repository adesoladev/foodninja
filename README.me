Food Ninja

Food Ninja is a demo food-themed web page created to learn and practice Tailwind CSS.  
The project is a simple front-end design that gives a glimpse of how a food platform might look. It includes sample layouts for food items, recipes, and minimal interface elements.

What the Project Does

The Food Ninja webpage is a static design that demonstrates:

- A clean and modern **UI layout** made with Tailwind CSS.  
- Responsive elements** that adjust to different screen sizes.  
- Sections that represent parts of a potential food or recipe platform, such as:
- Displaying food items.  
- Presenting simple recipe hints.  
- Highlighting minimal navigation or content sections.  

While the project is only a demo, it provides a good foundation for understanding how Tailwindâ€™s utility classes can be used to quickly build styled components without writing traditional CSS.
